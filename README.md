FAF_unit_DB_v2
==============

**Update 2016-10-16** - Has been abandoned at this point, I'm not even sure if the latest status of the repo is any good. Will eventually start working on a version 3 but lol at having time for that.

Version 2 of the FAF Unit Database project.

This is a unit database for the game Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, running the mod/client Forged Alliance Forever.

This is obviously still a work in progress, I'm doing this for the following reasons:

1. Teaching myself CodeIgniter

2. Current Unit DB could (in my opinion) use a face-lift and different layout. 

3. Trying to support the community however I can :)


All my starting assets where grabbed from GitHub user Spooky's existing FAF unit database project:

I know it's all open-source yadda yadda yadda but a big thank you! The effort to collect all the avatars, icons, etc. is just enormous!

Some more people are credited, they are recognized and linked to on the welcome screen view located at application/views/welcome.php

I hope I'm not stepping on anyones toes, or using material I don't have permission to. Please let me know if I am!!!

All code is written by myself.


You can find me in-game playing as Burka.


Cheers,
Burke Lougheed
