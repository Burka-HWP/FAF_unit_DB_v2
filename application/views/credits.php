        <h2>Credits!</h2>

        <p>While all the coding of the site is my work, I could not have done it without the contributions of several others!
        
        <p>An immense thank you to the following...</p>

        <ol>
            <li>deviantART user CB260
                <ul>
                    <li>Images for the race icons, etc. that I re-scaled for use.

                </ul>
            <li>GitHub user Spooky
                <ul>
                    <li>Usage of his unitdb repository to get all the unit avatars, strategic icons, attribute icons, background image, and others I'm sure for use. I know it's all open-source on GitHub yadda yadda yadda but a big thank you! The effort to collect all the avatars, icons, etc. is just enormous!
